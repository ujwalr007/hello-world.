The first one

Currently pursuing B.Tech degree at PES University, previous experiences line up from working on building a robotic arm to building the on board computer for RSAT satellite.

Looking for a research oriented internship. Have a good background in the field of Robotics and Automation. Specialization in VLSI domain. I'd put all my efforts into my work and strive for better results.
